Hello! This is all that you need to know so that you can add and change whatever you want without my help!

For the Home Page (AKA index.html file), to change the placeholder text just look for the <p> tag with the class of "placeholder", which you can keep the same if you want.

For the Gallery Page (AKA gallery.html file), if you want to add any images to it then you can simply just add to the class sections named "column" and just play around with
it to see what you think looks best. It's pretty simple to add to if you just play with it a bit to understand how it works and what each part of it does so that you can keep
adding to it and see what you think looks good.

For the blog page (AKA blog.html file), you'll need to make sure that you follow the intructions carefully...

1. Create a new file called something like blogpost.html, so its easier to find and change whenever you're looking for it.

2. Copy and paste the code from the placeholder files, or just use those for now if you want, and change the text in the <h1> tag with the class of "title" for the name of
the blog. Then change the contents of the <p> tag, which should be directly underneath the <h1> "title" tag, so that it contains the main text of the blog post.

3. Copy and paste the code, which should look like this:

<div class="blog blog4" onclick="location.replace('fourthblog.html')">
    <h1 style="margin-top: 77px;">
        Fourth Blog
    </h1>
</div>

, into the blog.html file inside of the section where all of the other links to blogs are kept (You will also need to change the "location.replace()" to the file 
that you want to link it to).

And that should be it for the blog pages.

For the contact page (AKA contact.html file) if you ever change email, or you decide that you want the messages to be sent to a different email, then just change the part
that reads "https://formspree.io/ryan1999brown@gmail.com" and change the email which is contained at the end of the link.

And last but not least, you will need to change all of the social media links in the places that i have instructed "add link here" on each page to the links to your profiles.


If you have any further questions about what to do then you know how to contact me.




Good luck, and enjoy the website :)
